# CIS1051-Final Journey

I ran into a couple of challenges while creating my website. The first challenge I encountered was fixing my terminal shell as my computer was outdated. At first the terminal on my computer was not running properly and would not allow me to install pip or flask which was needed to create my site. I figured out how to fix the terminal shell after some time. 

The next problem came when I was trying to add javacript and css to my website to make it more dynamic. I am working in pycharm community which does not support .css files unless I paid for Pycharm Professinal. I maybe should have created in VS Studios which I was exploring. I created the style.css file to try and change the color of the title but it was not working. 

I am overall happy that I was able to create a webpage with a couple of redirect sub pages. I have learned alot especially for just creating the bare basics for a website. Since I was having such trouble just getting my terminal to work, I learned about paths for shells, importance of directories, and how to download packages in the terminal (not in the interpreter) on pycharm. I enjoyed learning how to create different routes for webpages and understanding how websites and address bars are made. I wish I was able to make it a bit more dynamic with colors so I will explore more in VS studios.
