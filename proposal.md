# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Sabrina’s World 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that I can post pictures on for my portfolio. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am creating a website that will host pictures that I took of different pets and animals. It will have 2 sub pages. It will be executed using python. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A, I do not plan on using this for another course. 


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A, I am working alone. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I am hoping to at least develop a working webpage. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a working webpage and at least one sub page.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a an aesthetically pleasing webpage and 2 subpages full of pictures. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I am going to accomplish my project by using python and streamline. I will need to research how to create the actual website and how to upload pictures to it from my camera roll. I will also need to research how to create sub pages for the website and the level of difficulty to accomplish that.
